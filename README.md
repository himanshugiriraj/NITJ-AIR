# The NITJ-AIR Dataset: Promoting Research for Small and Tiny Object Detection
The present work focuses on the development of Large-Scale Open-Source Dataset to promote research for Small and Tiny Object Detection. For this purpose, a representative dataset dataset has been developed by flying the self-made UAV in the NITJ campus. The acquired video dataset has been converted into image samples and hence, consisting of 45,500 image samples with 3 object classes (Person, Motorcycle, Car). Moreover, these videos are acquired by varying the altitude from 5m to 30m.
